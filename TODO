How are the chromosomes ordered?  Is it by chromosome size?
   Chromosome 28 was out of place in the graphs I had.  The group
   recommended keeping the chromosomes in order from 1 -> 29 +x.
Can you make an option to change the text for chromosome 30 to be chromosome X.
Is it possible to make the width of the chromosome block thinner?  It seems to be a little bit too thick.
We were thinking about ways to show both the significance of
   interactions by coloring the lines and how to show the type of
   dominance (AA, AD/DA, DD) at the same time.  Would it be possible
   to color the chromosome block so that different slices of the
   chromosome were different colors based on the type of interaction-
   i.e.- the chromosomes would range from green to blue to red in
   color based on the type of epistasis across the same chromosome.
Would it be possible to put the genome coordinates on the inside of the chromosome ring with the coordinantes inbetween the chromosome block and the coordinate lines?
For the future... With interactive graphs- is it possible to make each chromosome blow up to a larger size when you put your cursor on it, kind of like the tool bar on a mac?  This way, a user could look at where lines originate from on a finer, more detailed scale.  

## Fix the direction part.
